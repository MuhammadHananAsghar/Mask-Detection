# Classification using CNN in Keras

```Keras``` is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. Up until version 2.3, Keras supported multiple backends, including TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, and PlaidML.

## Objectives
In this Project we create and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) , using ```Keras``` library. The objective of this project is to classifiy human faces with wearning masks or not wearing masks.

## DataSet
[Face Mask Detection ~12K Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset)

## Project Structure
- Task: Import Libraries and Helper functions
- Task: Download the Pet dataset and extract relevant annotations
- Task: Add functionality to create a random batch of examples and labels
- Task: Create a new CNN model in keras
- Task: Create a data generator function and calculate training and validation steps
- Task: Get predictions on a test batch and display the test batch along with prediction
